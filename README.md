## 📘 Project Overview

This project involves the development of an **Apiary Management System** designed for both **apiarists** (beekeepers) and **consumers**.

- **Apiarists** can use the system to:
  - Track bees, hives, and colonies
  - Record and receive reminders for hive inspections
  - Maintain sales and revenue via an accounting book feature

- **Consumers** can:
  - Enter a honey batch number to trace the specific hive location it was harvested from

The system promotes **traceability**, **biosecurity**, and **standardised hygiene practices** in honey production — addressing food safety concerns due to pests, diseases, and unsustainable harvesting methods in agriculture.
